            3.Seaborn.

#### Data Set : 
            1.tmdb-movies.csv

## Aim
Analyze the data and find out the hidden insights. 


## Conclusion
After analyzing the whole data set there are many insights that have been drawed out. People getting more and more connected to technology leads to great expansion in this market, as we can analyze the first chart - the profit in this market is exponentially growing. Now moving further to the questions and the results:

- Most Profitable Movie : $2544505847 (Avatar)

- Least Profitable Movie (loss) : -$413912431 (The warrior's way)

- Highest Budget : $425000000 (The Warrior's Way)

- Lowest Budget : $1 (Lost & Found)

- Highest Revenue : $2781505847 ( Avatar)

- Lowest Revenue : $2 (Shattered Glass)

- Highest Runtime : 338 (Carlos)

- Lowest Runtime : 15 (Kid's Story)

- Mean of runtime : 119 mins

- Maximum Profit Year : 2015

## Now we start the analysis for blockbuster movies which have profit more than $50M:

- Average runtime for most profitable movies : 119 mins

- Average budget for most profitabe movies : $60M

- Average revenue colletion for most profitable movies : $225M

- Most successful genre : Comedy

- Most successful director : Stephen Spielberg

- Most successful actor : Tom Cruise

###### So after carefully analyzing the data for blockbuster movies, we can conclude few factors on which the popularity of a movie depends on. The average time for the movie to be hit should be around 120 mins , average budget should be decided around $60M, the revenues collections could be neighbouring $225M, the recommended genre would be comedy , the prefered director is Steven Spielberg and with the conclusion if one contacts Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt or Tom Hanks it would be hit else if you can get all three of em' that would be triumph !
